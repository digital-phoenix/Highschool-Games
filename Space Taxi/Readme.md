#A port of the classic game Space Taxi

#Controls
Arrow keys to move

#Objective
Pick up passengers by landing on the platform their on and take them where they want to go,

#Note 
To land on the platform you have to hit it from above. If you hit it from any other direction then you'll die.
Also this is the only highschool game I made that had the levels in an external file.
